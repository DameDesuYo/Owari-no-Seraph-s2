Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.84,0:05:41.96,Owari,,0,0,0,,I haven't heard about this either.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.96,0:05:43.03,Owari,,0,0,0,,In any case,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.03,0:05:46.07,Owari,,0,0,0,,we have to decide whether we'll go along with whatever Lieutenant Colonel Guren's up to...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.07,0:05:51.66,Owari,,0,0,0,,Or rather, how we as a group will face this world.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.66,0:05:55.04,Owari,,0,0,0,,We want to hear you guys' thoughts and opinions on this.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.04,0:06:00.29,Owari,,0,0,0,,You're saying there's a possibility of us turning on the lieutenant colonel?

Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.96,0:06:47.14,Owari,,0,0,0,,I was thinking there might be a more efficient way to turn vampires into demons.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.09,0:06:50.05,Owari,,0,0,0,,Doesn't seem like it, though.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.05,0:06:53.38,Owari,,0,0,0,,I guess low-level trash won't do.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.38,0:06:54.68,Owari,,0,0,0,,You can kill them.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.68,0:06:56.94,Owari,,0,0,0,,Don't tell me what to do.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.94,0:06:58.68,Owari,,0,0,0,,Just hurry up and tell me why I'm here.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.68,0:07:00.73,Owari,,0,0,0,,Did you really come alone?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.73,0:07:03.10,Owari,,0,0,0,,Wasn't that what you ordered?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.10,0:07:05.38,Owari,,0,0,0,,It never occurred to you that you might be murdered here?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.38,0:07:06.94,Owari,,0,0,0,,Why should I worry about that?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.27,0:07:08.95,Owari,,0,0,0,,Because you're too cheeky.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.89,0:07:12.01,Owari,,0,0,0,,If that was all I was, I'd have been dead a long time ago.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.74,0:07:14.95,Owari,,0,0,0,,You won't kill me as long as you can use me.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.78,0:07:21.44,Owari,,0,0,0,,You're right.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.44,0:07:24.35,Owari,,0,0,0,,I won't kill you as long as long as you're useful.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.35,0:07:29.72,Owari,,0,0,0,,So let me ask you a few questions to determine how useful you still are.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.63,0:07:32.32,Owari,,0,0,0,,Hyakuya Yuuichirou...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.32,0:07:33.72,Owari,,0,0,0,,Saotome Yoichi...

Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.86,0:07:46.95,Owari,,0,0,0,,How else would I be able to find such unusually talented—
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.95,0:07:48.48,Owari,,0,0,0,,Impossible.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.81,0:07:53.01,Owari,,0,0,0,,Every single Black Demon prospect came from human experimentation.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:53.01,0:07:55.60,Owari,,0,0,0,,And very few people survive those experiments.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.73,0:07:58.57,Owari,,0,0,0,,Well, it's fine.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.57,0:08:01.42,Owari,,0,0,0,,It's not like having more Black Demon wielders is a bad thing.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:04.69,0:08:06.50,Owari,,0,0,0,,If I feel like it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.93,0:08:09.16,Owari,,0,0,0,,Was that all you wanted?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.16,0:08:11.42,Owari,,0,0,0,,If so, I'm leaving.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:12.24,0:08:13.76,Owari,,0,0,0,,Next question.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:14.33,0:08:17.85,Owari,,0,0,0,,Why are you suddenly gathering up Black Demon wielders?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.85,0:08:19.77,Owari,,0,0,0,,Are you planning a coup d'état?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.85,0:08:22.52,Owari,,0,0,0,,If I was,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:22.52,0:08:24.96,Owari,,0,0,0,,it would make sense for me to cut you down right here and now.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.77,0:08:27.52,Owari,,0,0,0,,As if you could.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.10,0:08:29.56,Owari,,0,0,0,,Want to find out?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:29.56,0:08:31.08,Owari,,0,0,0,,That brings me back.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:32.34,0:08:34.68,Owari,,0,0,0,,But there's no need for that.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:34.68,0:08:36.75,Owari,,0,0,0,,You're doing a fine job.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:37.88,0:08:40.54,Owari,,0,0,0,,But I know your weakness.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:41.12,0:08:43.12,Owari,,0,0,0,,Love and friendship.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:43.12,0:08:46.41,Owari,,0,0,0,,You know very well that you're better off ignoring those things.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:47.13,0:08:49.30,Owari,,0,0,0,,But you can't.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:51.20,0:08:55.38,Owari,,0,0,0,,And that's exactly why I can trust you, Guren.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:56.29,0:08:58.22,Owari,,0,0,0,,Because you can't betray your friends.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.22,0:09:00.80,Owari,,0,0,0,,You won't ever be a threat to me.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:00.80,0:09:04.63,Owari,,0,0,0,,Is this the part where you bring out another hostage?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:04.63,0:09:06.20,Owari,,0,0,0,,Who is it this time?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:06.20,0:09:07.94,Owari,,0,0,0,,What do you want to squeeze out of me?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:08.27,0:09:10.10,Owari,,0,0,0,,Don't put it like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:12.61,0:09:13.72,Owari,,0,0,0,,Guren,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:14.38,0:09:16.80,Owari,,0,0,0,,what do you see in our future?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:16.80,0:09:20.20,Owari,,0,0,0,,There's no point in surviving in a world like this.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:20.20,0:09:22.52,Owari,,0,0,0,,I'm sure there are people who think like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:23.47,0:09:26.31,Owari,,0,0,0,,Did you call me out here to complain?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:26.31,0:09:29.79,Owari,,0,0,0,,I just want to know what your vision is.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:30.72,0:09:33.80,Owari,,0,0,0,,This world is devoid of hopes and dreams,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:33.80,0:09:36.46,Owari,,0,0,0,,and yet you continue to bolster your military power.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:37.29,0:09:38.78,Owari,,0,0,0,,For what purpose?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:38.78,0:09:42.38,Owari,,0,0,0,,Because this is a world where more power is always needed.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:42.38,0:09:43.72,Owari,,0,0,0,,Naturally.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.39,0:09:47.66,Owari,,0,0,0,,But why bother if you have nothing to strive for?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:48.67,0:09:51.23,Owari,,0,0,0,,Those who sacrifice others in vain...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:51.85,0:09:52.73,Owari,,0,0,0,,are evil.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:52.73,0:09:54.84,Owari,,0,0,0,,Evil, huh?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:55.46,0:09:58.09,Owari,,0,0,0,,I'm going to restore the world, Guren.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:59.19,0:10:04.96,Owari,,0,0,0,,The vampires destroyed all means of communicating outside the country,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:04.96,0:10:07.87,Owari,,0,0,0,,but I suspect there are other human organizations left out there.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:08.39,0:10:09.67,Owari,,0,0,0,,Probably.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:10.50,0:10:15.13,Owari,,0,0,0,,So for now your goal is to restore \Ncommunications with the rest of the world?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:15.75,0:10:16.81,Owari,,0,0,0,,No.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:16.81,0:10:20.43,Owari,,0,0,0,,First, I'm going to get rid of all the vampires in this country.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:20.43,0:10:21.14,Owari,,0,0,0,,Then,
